# restaid
Converts JSON to XML and back again. Exposes a set of object manipulation functions to traverse object easily which includes: getting size of object, deep searching object, building sizzle (jquery) like string to preform deep search, storing each last so objects to not have to be passed as parameters either by reference or by this pointer, builds adhoc traversal similar to Windows(r) FindFirstFile and FindNextFile
